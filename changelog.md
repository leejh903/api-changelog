# Changelog

A changelog for a changelog extension. Trying to walk the walk.

## Draft 02 (2019-07-13)

- Added a [Use Case](./use-case.md) document to share why this might be valuable to you.
- Added support for `$ref`. Changelog information can be separate from the API description but linked by way of a `$ref`.
- Added an `announcement` field for use when conveying public information about an API change.
- Added the ability to add a changelog to the root OpenAPI Object so API-wide changes can be expressed.
- Included a new section about the `deprecated` conflict with OpenAPI.
- Updated the document for the sake of clarity.
- Added this changelog to share what's changed.
